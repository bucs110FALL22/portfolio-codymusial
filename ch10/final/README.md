# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(My main program uses an api to get data on cryptocurrencies and their price and uses the second api to exchange the currency values. My other program uses an API containing data on movies and their box office earnings and converts the earnings to other currencies using another API containing currency exchange rates.)*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(it doesnt run, the api's wouldn't work and I couldn't get any of its data so I couldnt make any variables to print my code.)*

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(I sent you an email in regards to my mentals conditions, I struggled with the timeframe and couldn't finish. My main.py is still all the code together and I haven't gotten the opportunity to complete the code. As I spoke about with you before the project was a struggle and I had to use up all my time trying to figure out how to come up with it by myself while my tempature was fluctuating from 101 to 92)*
